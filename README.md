# TestPython
This code provides a basic simulation of a file system. You can interact with it by typing commands like `mkdir`, `touch`, `ls`, `cd`, and `exit`. For instance:

*   `mkdir /folder_name` will create a new folder named `folder_name`.
*   `touch /file.txt` will create a new file named `file.txt`.
*   `ls /` will list all files and folders in the root directory.
*   `cd /folder_name` will change the current directory to `folder_name`.
*   `exit` will exit the program.
